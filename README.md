# BSP6 Project Overview

This repository contains code and data files related to a comprehensive gene expression and network analysis project. The focus is on analyzing differential gene expression and investigating pathway and network perturbations.

## Repository Structure

- **CODE/**  
  Contains scripts and outputs used for various stages of the analysis.  
  - **Network_Analysis/**  
    Includes Java programs (JAR files) and R scripts that perform network generation, differential network analysis, perturbation analysis, and post-processing steps.  
    This folder also holds network data files, gene expression matrices, adjacency lists, perturbation results, and images visualizing network phenotypes.  
  - R scripts and datasets for statistical analysis such as pathway enrichment, differential expression, and Fisher exact tests are present at the top level of the CODE directory.
